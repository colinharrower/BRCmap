			 data where the geographic information is stored as UK, Irish or Channel Island grid 
			 reference character strings. Includes functions to reformat grid references to different precisions, 
			 convert them to eastings and northings, latitude and longitudes, or convert them
			 to R spatial polygons or points objects using the sp or sf packages.
